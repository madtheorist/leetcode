# Leetcode

A repository for my attempts at Leetcode problems.

Setup on a mac:

```
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

To run tests with pytest, run

```
python -m pytest tests
```

in the root directory. Or use e.g.

```
python -m pytest tests/test_dynamic_programming.py
```

to run a specific test module.
